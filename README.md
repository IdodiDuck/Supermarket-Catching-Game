# ****Supermarket PyGame Project:**** - ****Published at 04/10/2022****

## **Welcome to my first Python game! SuperMarket Game**

```Still in progress..```
---
## **What is this Repository about?:**
The project is about a supermarket game, the goal of the game is to catch the falling food objects, reach points and reach high levels. The velocity of the objects will get higher when going to higher levels. If a food object reaches the floor 3 times, that's a game-over.

## **How to play?**

Move the maincart of the game by using the right and left arrow keys/buttons in the keyboard located right to the shift/enter buttons.


## **Knowledge used in the repository:**

- `Pygame -> Library functions, methods, classes and importations.`
- `OOP -> Object Oriented Programming -> Classes, Instances, Attributes, Methods, Inheritance...`
